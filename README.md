🚗 WhatNext Vision Motors – Salesforce CRM
Shaping the Future of Mobility with Innovation and Excellence
A Salesforce CRM solution designed for an automotive dealership to manage vehicles, customers, dealers, vehicle orders, test drives, and service requests in a centralized platform.

📌 Project Overview
WhatNext Vision Motors is a customized Salesforce CRM application developed to simplify and automate the major operations of an automotive dealership.

The system provides a centralized platform where dealership users can manage vehicle inventory, customer information, dealers, vehicle purchases, test-drive appointments, and service requests.

The project combines Salesforce's declarative tools such as Flows and Validation Rules with programmatic development using Apex and Triggers.

The main goal is to reduce manual work, improve data accuracy, prevent invalid vehicle orders, and provide better visibility into dealership operations.

🎯 Objectives
Centralize dealership-related information in Salesforce.
Manage vehicle inventory and availability.
Maintain customer and dealer information.
Manage vehicle purchase orders.
Prevent orders for unavailable vehicles.
Automate dealer assignment.
Automate test-drive reminder notifications.
Manage vehicle service requests.
Maintain data accuracy using Validation Rules and Apex.
Provide business insights using Reports and Dashboards.
Implement secure and controlled access to Salesforce data.
🏗️ Main Modules
🚘 1. Vehicle Management
The Vehicle module manages the vehicles available in the dealership.

It stores information such as:

Vehicle Model
Vehicle Type
Price
Stock Quantity
Availability Status
Dealer
This module helps users monitor the available vehicle inventory.

👤 2. Customer Management
The Customer module stores customer information.

It includes:

Customer Name
Email
Phone Number
Address
Preferred Vehicle Type
Customer records can be associated with orders, test drives, and service requests.

🏢 3. Dealer Management
The Dealer module maintains dealer information such as:

Dealer Name
Dealer Code
Location
Phone Number
Email Address
Dealers can be associated with vehicles and vehicle orders.

🛒 4. Vehicle Order Management
The Vehicle Order module manages customer vehicle purchases.

An order connects:

Customer → Vehicle → Dealer → Order

The system checks vehicle stock before an order can be confirmed.

If the vehicle is unavailable, the order is prevented from being confirmed.

🚗 5. Test Drive Management
The Test Drive module manages customer test-drive appointments.

It stores:

Customer
Vehicle
Test Drive Date
Test Drive Status
Automated reminders are sent for upcoming test drives.

🔧 6. Service Request Management
The Service Request module handles post-purchase service requirements.

It stores:

Customer
Vehicle
Service Date
Issue Description
Service Status
This allows dealership users to track service requests efficiently.

🗂️ Salesforce Data Model
The project contains six major custom objects:

Custom Object	Purpose
Vehicle__c	Stores vehicle and inventory information
Vehicle_Dealer__c	Stores dealer information
Vehicle_Customer__c	Stores customer information
Vehicle_Order__c	Manages vehicle purchase orders
Vehicle_Test_Drive__c	Manages test-drive appointments
Vehicle_Service_Request__c	Manages vehicle service requests

⚙️ Automation
🔄 Salesforce Flow
Salesforce Flow is used to automate repetitive business processes.

1. Dealer Assignment Flow
When a new vehicle order is created:

New Vehicle Order
        ↓
Get Order Information
        ↓
Identify Appropriate Dealer
        ↓
Assign Dealer to Order
        ↓
Update Order
This reduces manual dealer assignment and improves the order workflow.

2. Test Drive Reminder Flow
The system monitors upcoming test-drive appointments.

Test Drive Created
        ↓
Check Appointment Date
        ↓
Identify Upcoming Test Drive
        ↓
Send Reminder Email
This helps reduce missed appointments and improves customer communication.

🛡️ Validation Rules
A major business rule in the project is Vehicle Stock Validation.

The system should not allow an order to be confirmed when the selected vehicle has no available stock.

Example
Vehicle Stock = 0
        ↓
User tries to Confirm Order
        ↓
Stock Validation
        ↓
❌ Order Confirmation Prevented
If stock is available:

Vehicle Stock > 0
        ↓
Order Confirmation
        ↓
Stock Updated
        ↓
✅ Order Successfully Processed
This prevents incorrect orders and maintains inventory accuracy.

💻 Apex Development
Apex is used to implement advanced business logic that cannot be handled only through declarative configuration.

The project includes Apex logic for:

Vehicle order processing
Stock validation
Order management
Business logic handling
Apex Trigger
An Apex Trigger is used in the vehicle order process.

The trigger:

Checks vehicle stock.
Prevents invalid order processing.
Processes confirmed transactions.
Updates vehicle stock.
Supports order status handling.
The trigger is kept lightweight, while the main business logic is handled through separate Apex classes.

Order Processing Flow
Vehicle Order
      ↓
Check Vehicle Stock
      ↓
 ┌───────────────┐
 │ Stock Available? │
 └───────┬───────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
   YES        NO
    │         │
    ▼         ▼
Confirm    Prevent Order
Order
    │
    ▼
Update Stock
🎨 Lightning Experience
The project uses Salesforce Lightning Experience to provide a centralized and user-friendly interface.

The Lightning application provides navigation to:

🚘 Vehicles
🏢 Dealers
👤 Customers
🛒 Orders
🚗 Test Drives
🔧 Service Requests
UI Configuration
The project uses:

Lightning App
Lightning Record Pages
Page Layouts
Dynamic Forms
Highlights Panel
Related Lists
Tabs
This provides users with easy access to relevant information.

📊 Reports & Dashboards
Reports and Dashboards are used to provide business visibility.

Reports
Reports can be created to analyze:

Vehicle inventory
Vehicle orders
Customers
Test drives
Service requests
Pending orders
Dashboards
Dashboards provide visual summaries of dealership operations.

Example dashboard components:

┌────────────────────┐
│ Vehicle Inventory  │
└────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────┐
│ Order Activity     │
└────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────┐
│ Test Drive Status  │
└────────────────────┘

┌────────────────────┐
│ Service Requests   │
└────────────────────┘
This allows management to understand business activity quickly.

🔐 Security
Security is implemented using Salesforce's standard security mechanisms.

Security Components
Profiles – Define basic user permissions.
Roles – Help control record visibility.
Role Hierarchy – Provides hierarchical access.
Permission Sets – Provide additional permissions.
Sharing Rules – Extend record access when required.
Object-Level Permissions – Control access to objects.
The objective is to ensure that users have access only to the information required for their responsibilities.

🧪 Testing
The application was tested using multiple functional scenarios.

Test Case	Expected Result
Create valid vehicle	Vehicle record created successfully
Confirm order with available stock	Order can be processed
Confirm order with zero stock	Order confirmation prevented
Create upcoming test drive	Reminder automation triggered
Process pending order	Order processed when required stock is available
Testing helps ensure that the business rules, automation, and Apex logic work as expected.
